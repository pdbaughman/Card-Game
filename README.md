# Card-Game

Problem? – The problem our project hopes to solve is that elderly people frequently face cognitive decline due to inactivity. We hope to create a game that will stimulate and improve their cognitive abilities.

How? – Our project is to create a game based on the card game where you must flip over cards one at a time and match the images. Our game will expand upon this idea, and instead of matching images, you would match concepts (such as chicken and egg, or dog and cat).  

Monetize? – We will use ads to monetize our app
